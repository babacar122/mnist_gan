# Mnist GAN project

This project is my attempt to apply various neural networks to the mnist digits dataset to try to generate new images.
We have a :
- Convolutional Variational Autoencoder
- Generative Adversarial Network
- A diffusion model

We have implemented it first using tensorflow and afterwards we adapt the architecture to the Pytorch librairy.
